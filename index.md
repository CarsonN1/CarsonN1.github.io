## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 1 
This is the starting lab out of all the labs over this semester. This first lab really grabbed my interest, seeing my code work in real time was a shocker. This lab was definitely my motivation to keep studying computer science. 


Lab 2, part 2
This gave me my first real taste of coding from scratch. It gave me an insight into how computers can solve real life math questions. I find it interesting that this is similar to how calculators work and how much code goes into them.


Lab 6, part 2
This is one of my favorite labs because it is a game I enjoy playing in real life. It also challenged my coding skills, at first it was challenging but then I got the code down. I love the fact that I can play and test the game for myself after I complete the coding.
